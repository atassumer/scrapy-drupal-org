S'Had some happy hour drinks on the 4th of July here. Very divey bar with some good taps. We stayed for an hour or so and shared conversation with a friendly girl running the bar for a bit until things started to pick up towards the end of happy hour. \n\nSeems like a fun place to catch some live music and enjoy a few drinks for those who dare not be drove off by some dust and cobwebs.\n'

S"Well, this place is ok, but not somewhere I'd go out of my way to go to.\n\nCame here on a Friday night for a gypsy/belly dance/burlesque themed show, whatever that's supposed to mean. Walked up and there was a $15 cover charge. Seriously? Ugh. I wouldn't have gone in if it weren't for the fact that we were supposed to meet people there.\n\nThe bar itself is pretty tiny and you can definitely feel it. I had to step outside multiple times due to the smell of B.O. radiating around the room. It's also pretty humid in there. As for the drinks: beer, wine, & soju drinks only? I don't know about you, but I'm not a big fan of getting sleepy at the beginning of the night. $5 for a beer is about average in these parts.\n\nStaff was ok. Doorman was super friendly, but bartender girls were kind of miserable. As for the show, it was pretty entertaining. Very off the wall and San Francisco, so if you think it's worth $15, then this place might be for you. Otherwise, not so sure. I spent half the night standing outside.\n\nI was originally going to give this place 3 stars, but upon re-reading this review, I realized I liked it even less than I thought I did. \n\nTip: Bring cash! This is a cash only place. Ugh.\n"

S"Nice intimate venue to hear some live music. Saw Lee Gallagher & the Hallelujah play here last night and it was awesome. I'm not much of a rock n roll kind of girl but they are an amazing band and I had a good time listening to their music. Definitely recommend catching these guys live, super talented! \n\nMy only gripe about the bar is they don't serve hard liquor. They do have an extensive selection of beer, wine and soju cocktails. But unfortunately, this girl needs her whiskey. Seating is sparse but we came around 8-9p and were able to grab a table. I also didn't have to pay for cover when I came in because I didn't leave. But when my boyfriend went out for a smoke, he had to pay cover to get in. \n\nI'll definitely come back to see this band play again!\n"

There was only one bartender (who I believe has been there only for 2 days) on a night of holiday weekend which I thought wasn't very logical but she handled it pretty good!\nMinus one start for being a cash only bar. Also, they need to fix the ladies bathroom door and plug the hole in it\n"

S'As far as "dive bars" go this place is a dive. No joke. I almost had to dive to get out once I got in! Mind you, this was a Friday night, so I can\'t be overly critical. \xc2\xa0I will say that the heat from inside the place hit me before I was actually in the bar. Now I have a pretty fair idea of what h3ll must feel like. Our group didn\'t want to stand, or have frizzy hair, so we left with a relative quickness!\n\nIn surveying the place I could see that under ambient circumstances it might not be a bad place to have a brew. So under ambient circumstances I would be more than happy to return. :-)\n\nP.S. I liked what little I heard of the live performance from the band that night. SCORE!\n'

S"I have to say my piece about my past two visits to Amnesia because I am a long-time customer and performer at this venue and it has been near and dear to me for some years.\n\nThe staff have been surprisingly snooty, and not-so-friendly - kind of a too-hip-to-care attitude. I went to see The Japonize Elephants last Thursday (FABULOUS!) and first walked up to the guy running the door. I got a cold, appraising look from the guy. Same from the bartender who, despite the bar not being busy really took her time getting around to serving me and even walked away as I tried to hand her money, then took a little while to come back and make change.\n\nThe booking is still great at Amnesia, lots of groups I want to see. I've just been sad to encounter the staff who don't seem to care much about being friendly to customers, especially as it used to be a very friendly place not so long ago. Plus, I read another review about it being humid - I did go to see a show at Amnesia during Pride weekend (a hot one!) and they didn't have the fan on inside which I thought strange. I asked the sound-person if she could turn it on and she seemed to not know they had a fan. But it was turned on a little later. I don't know what's up with that. \xc2\xa0\n\n I am wondering if ownership has changed, but, in case anyone who has power to do anything about management of this lovely, wonderful, musical and artistic venue reads this, PLEASE take a good look at your staff and their attitude toward your customers! (and maybe build a better, new stage for dancers ;))\n"

S'I\'ve been spoiled by attentive and knowledgeable bartenders during my time in San Francisco, so I was taken aback when the guy behind the bar at Amnesia answered "I don\'t know" twice to our pretty simple recommendation requests. Not that I expect them to be sucking on every tap in the place, or a thorough dissertation on the sensory journey you\'ll have via your PBR, but I wish he knew the product more. He did get excited about the city specials, locally brewed beers that ended up being damn good. \xc2\xa0The Green Flash I decided on was the winner of the night, and by the second round, I had converted the entire table to it. \n\nAmnesia is a smaller place, with frequent jazz performances, and a more relaxed/mature crowd that most Mission bars. I could see it getting quite packed on a Friday or Saturday night, and it\'s beer/wine only. The music was a bit too loud for an intimate conversation, but if they turned the soundtrack down, it might be a great place to really enjoy what you\'re drinking. But you may not get much help from the bartender, so be prepared to play a bit of beer roulette.\n'

S"Went here wednesday night to see the band Gaucho. And oh how I loved them. They played gipsy jazz aka gypsy swing. Gypsy swing is surely more hummable and has a very distinctive tune to it. Heavily guitar based as opposed to a saxophone dominated american jazz. People were swing dancing and the atmosphere was just amazing. Gaucho plays here every wednesday and I'd definitely be back for some more jazz.\n"

S"Amnesia is one of those bars that I come to, have a great time and then promptly forget about for the next 9-10 months. But when I make the trip again, I realize what a great bar it is and ask myself why I don't come as often.\n\nI dropped by here to meet up with a date on Halloween. The space was dark, the beer was cool and there was a pretty kick ass blues band playing- the complete opposite of my first time here. \n\nThe bar only has soju drinks, beer and beer (no hard liquor) but the drinks are cheap and you can never go wrong with a tall glass of Downtown Brown. \n\nThere were some chicks selling delicious tacos outside and I didn't even mind that my date was running late. I was enjoying being by myself drinking a good beer and talking to the bartender. \n\nEventually my date arrived and we headed to our next destination but I left wondering yet again why I don't come here more and was reminded why I SHOULD come more often.\n"

S'For a long time I have had Amnesia bookmarked for their weekly free jazz night and I have yet to check it out. My first experience here was actually to see the band Y La Bamba. This is a great little venue. It reminded me of some of the small music venues down in L.A. I\'m only 5\'3" and I hate going to concerts and not being able to see anything but people\'s split ends or their arm pits. That was not the case at Amnesia. The stage is at a good height so you can actually see even if you\'re a shorty like me. The sound was pretty decent too.\n\nI arrived a little early to make sure that I could get to see the band. I ordered the "Daisy" soju cocktail. It was very sweet but it has a nice kick to it and it has my name so what\'s not to like? They have some good drink deals and even $2 PBR. I think it was $2 or maybe $3. They also make a pretty good sangria.\n\nI enjoyed my first time at Amnesia and even made a new friend so this place gets 4 stars. I hope to check out the jazz night in the near future.\n'

S'Unfortunately I had a poor experience here. Upon entering and sitting down with a friend I was called a "stupid ni**er wh*re" by one of the bars patrons (who turned out to be a homeless guy, however I couldn\'t tell due to the pitch black darkness of the establishment). I told one of the bartenders and they said "there was nothing they could do about it, sorry," however there WAS something they could do about it. Kick the dude out because they have the right to refuse service to any patron and the guy was just loitering. He didn\'t even have a drink, so sadly I will not be going to this bar again but I doubt I\'m missing out on anything that spectacular.\n'

S"I've been to Amnesia two or three times, twice on a Wednesday night to see Gaucho, and once to see Y La Bamba on a weekend (I think). It's a nice little local bar in the mission, and there's no cover on Wednesdays to see Gaucho, which is fantastic. \n\nI had one not-so-great experience when Y La Bamba was playing, otherwise I would've given this place at least 4 stars. I can usually deal with being shoulder to shoulder at concerts, but at the Y La Bamba show I was so uncomfortable and hot that I had to leave early, even though I'm a huge fan of their music. There were waayyy too many people in there and I'm positive we went way over the maximum capacity. I was stepped on and pushed constantly, and my boyfriend had his raincoat stolen. More people kept squeezing in and I didn't see anyone turned away...I would not have paid for a ticket if I knew how crowded it was going to get! \n\nI'd be happy to go back on a Wednesday, but I'm definitely not going back on a weekend.\n"

S'In the wide world of small music venues, Amnesia is in A-OK-Land.\n\nI like that it\'s fairly accessible to BART, halfway between the 16th and 24th St stations. I like the cheap covers, typically $7-10. I like how in-your-face the performances can feel. I like the extensive cocktail menu printed clearly on a chalk board above the bar, and the splendid selection of euro brews and wines too. Makes me question the "dive bar" category they\'ve been put into...\n\nWhat I don\'t like is the sometimes rude bartenders, the disgusting bathroom, nearly nonexistent seating, and limited surfaces to set your drink down. I would like to think the difference between large and small music venues is that smaller spots can be comfier and less chaotic, but Amnesia is so small it could be called Claustrophobia instead. We felt like we were dodging people all night. Even the band looked cramped up on stage. \n\nIt\'s a fine venue to get up-close personal with a band you\'re obsessed with, while sipping some above-par hooch, but for just hanging out this spot is a bit too cozy for me.\n'

Both times paid off big time.\n\nAmnesia is a super fun dive bar in the Mission. I'd walked by before and seen it packed, but Friday was perfect: not too crowded, not too empty, and one of the best DJs I've seen in a long time. Incredible blend of funk, 80's, hip hop and other awesomeness. They even threw in some reggae. My group didn't stop dancing until we left (and even then probably danced some more outside--hey its the Mission and that sort of thing is about as tame as it gets). \n\nI also found the single bartender to be both friendly and well below the pretension level your typical beer bar seems to have in this town.

S"I came here for the first time for a music event, a business promoting themselves to musicians in the community. This was just the other week. The event was fine, venue is ok, a little crowded. Although what was a huge turn off was the door guy. The event I attended just ended, and I was walking around and knew I had a friend outside, so I went to check really quick if he was still there. I was literally outside for a few seconds and headed back inside. The door guy told me I had to pay. What do you mean pay? Since I left for a second, the next event was starting and a band was playing and they wanted me to pay for that. I told the door guy I left just for a second and he said there were signs outside for the event. I was inside the event the whole time. I told him, had I known if I took a step outside that I would need to pay for the next event, I wouldn't have walked outside. This guy didn't care and it just showed me how greedy and stupid this venue is. The event they just held were for local musicians, and I'm a local musician that has been putting together events in San Francisco. This was my first time at this venue and I have no desire to ever come back or hold an event there. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. \n\nI'm sure the venue is fine for shows, but if you're gonna start charging guests for walking past an imaginary line, just ridiculous.

They don't serve any hard liquor, just beer, a bit of wine, and a couple of other more unusual brews. Same attentive bartender both times. The place gets pretty packed on Wednesday nights, but there's still a bit of dance space in the front. Some people dress up, as in vintage. Super cute.
